# 👋 Hi, I'm Elif

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

This account contains test automation and testing practice projects
created during different stages of my learning journey, including
**interview assignments**, **automation experiments**, and **practice work**.

## 🧪 About Me

I am a test-oriented professional with hands-on experience in:
- Test automation fundamentals
- API testing concepts
- Understanding test flows and test design

Some of the repositories here were created as part of **technical interview
assignments** or **learning exercises** a few years ago.  
They are intentionally kept public to reflect my approach to testing
and my learning process over time.

## 🎯 Current Focus

Currently, I am focusing on:
- Refreshing core API testing concepts
- Improving test design and test scenario creation
- Strengthening automation fundamentals
- Preparing for technical interviews in test engineering roles

## 💬 Final Note

This profile reflects **practical exposure and learning progress** rather than
continuous open-source contribution.  
Recent hands-on work has mainly been done in **company-internal or local setups**.

Feel free to explore the repositories.
